I wanted an automatic and silent way to switch my Windows desktop wallpaper according to sunrise/sunset times (7 AM and 6 PM, respectively in my location). So I prompted Copilot to write a Powershell script that could pull between two different wallpapers (one for daytime, one for nighttime) depending on the time of day. The idea was to schedule a task in Task Scheduler using the Powershell script
as the action, and using the abovementioned sunrise/sunset times as triggers for the task. Though it worked, there was always a brief period of time when the Powershell window would suddenly pop up and close, which proved to be distracting. So I prompted Copilot again to write a VB wrapper to run the Powershell script completely in the background without resulting in any window pop-ups.
